## WavetecRR's Raspberry Pi Starter Guide!

If you recieved a Raspbery Pi for either Christmas or your birthday, count yourself lucky! For many years, the Raspberry Pi Foundation has made low cost computers in many shapes and sizes! So, seeing as I am a programmer that has owned a few Raspberry Pi's before, I'm going to teach you what you should do when you get one!

## Step one

If you got your Raspberry Pi in a kit like most people do, be sure to take everything out of the boxes, and consider reading the book(s) that come in the box. Even if you know how the Raspberry Pi works, I would **strongly reccomend** reading it as it has a bunch of useful information about how to set it up and how to make a bunch of different projects in Python, Scratch and more!

## Step two (only applies if you have a blank SD Card)

If you have purchased a Raspberry Pi without or with a blank MicroSD Card, you will need to image the card with either [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe) or [BalenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher), though it is reccommended to flash with the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe) as you won't need to download the image file for the OS you want. Still, it your decision what you use. **If you have a Raspberry Pi that came with a MicroSD Card with NOOBS (New Out Of Box Software) or Raspberry Pi OS (Previously Raspbian), you DO NOT need to follow this step, and can move onto the next one!**

## Step three

Nost of the time, when you purchase a Raspberry Pi in a kit, you will receive a case to put it in. To put the case on, first of all, remove the MicroSD Card and put it somewhere safe. Remove all connected wires as well. Next up, take the Raspberry Pi and put it in the bottom half of the case **with the MicroSD Card removed**. Afterwards, attach the top half of the case and push it together until you hear it click together! After this, you can plug in your MicroSD Card and all the wires required to get power to the Pi. Don't forget the keyboard and mouse! If you're Pi didn't come with one, you can simply purchase one in stores or on the internet. If you have a Raspberry Pi 400, you don't need to worry about this. You also need a monitor or TV. If you have one of those, then okay, you are all set up!

## Step four

Now that you have everything plugged in, and your TV or monitor is set to the correct input, you can go ahead and connect the power adaptor to the wall and the Raspberry Pi. If you followed all of the instructions correctly, you're Raspberry Pi should come on with the setup wizard! If it doesn't you may have done something wrong. Don't worry! Accidents like this happen all of the time, and with a little bit of work, you can fix whatever went wrong!

## Step five (only applies if you have NOOBS on your MicroSD Card)

If you have NOOBS on your MicroSD Card, you can select the OS you want in the little checkbox next to the OS you want. If the OS you want isn't listed, you can click on the WiFi button on the top ribbon and connect the Pi to WiFi. When you connect it to WiFi, you'll need to have your router's password handy. If you don't know it, ask your parents or check the back of your router. If the OS you want still doesn't appear, it may not be available within NOOBS. If this is the case, choose an operating system you might like and click on the little checkbox. If you dont like the OS you chose, you don't need to live with it forever! Simply push shift while booting up the Pi, push C on the keyboard or click on Clear on the top ribbon and chose the OS you want to install

## Step six

If you have Raspberry Pi OS on your MicroSD Card, follow the instructions on the screen to set the install of Raspberry Pi OS up. If all goes well, you will eventually see the desktop! When you see this, you have successfully set up Raspberry Pi OS!
